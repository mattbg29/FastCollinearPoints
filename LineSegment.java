 *  This was completed as part of Princeton's Algorithms class, for more on the assignment,

 *  The goal of the assignment is, given a collection of data points, identify those groups of
 *  4 or more points that are collinear, ie that form a line.
 *  The code below was supplied by the course to work in tandem with my own code in the other associated classes.
